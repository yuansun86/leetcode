Using dynamic programming from back to front would be very time-consuming o(N^2).
Instead we should use greedy algorithm, we can set currentbest index as the left most index that can reach to destination.
Initially, currentbest is the last index of the array. We scan from back to front, and check if each index is able to surpass the currentbest index. If so, we update the currentbest index
to i.
The final result is to check if currentbest is 0.
